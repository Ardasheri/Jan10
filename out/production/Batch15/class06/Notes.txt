Logical Operators:

Logical Operators allow us to combine multiple conditions.
They only work with boolean(true/false) values.
There are 3 logical operators - (!, ||, &&)

Why should we use logical operators:
1) They can greatly simplify the logic.
2) It helps us  reduce the lines of code that we have to write.

NOT(!):
It reverses the condition. If something is true, it will be maDE FALSE, and if something is false,
then it will be made true
sout(!true)-> false

Logical Or operator(||):
It can combine 2 or more conditions and return tue as long as there is one true condition is true.
If all the conditions become false, it returns false.

Logical AND(&&):
It can also combine 2 or more conditions. It only return true if all the conditions are true
