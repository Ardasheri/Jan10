Operators:
    Operators are different symbols that we can use to perform operations like addition, subtraction,
    we can compare things if 2 entities are same or not if a number is greater than the other number or not.
    There are three main types of operators. They are arithmetic operators, Relational operators and logical
    operators.
Arithmetic operators:
    We use arithmetic operators to perform simple math operations. Like addition, subtraction etc.
    + => addition
    - => subtraction
    / => division
    * => multiplication
    % => modulus/remainder
Relational operators:
    Used to compare 2 quantities or entities. Ex. if something is bigger than another thing or if 2
    numbers are same or not or if 2 boolean variables contain same values or not.
    == => used to check if 2 variables contain the same value or not if we get the same we get true, otherwise
    we get false.
    != => used to check if 2 variables don't contain the same value. We get true if they are not the same.
    > => used to check if one value is greater than the other value or not, if greater, we get a true.
    < => used to check if one value on the left is less than the value on the right side, then we get true.
    >= => if the value on left is greater than the value on the right side or if they are the same, we will get true
    <= => it opposite of >= and is used to check if something is less than or equal to other thing.
Conditional constructs:
Used to write conditional code. A piece of code that executes based on a condition, if condition is true, java
executes the code, otherwise it skips the code.
How to write IfElse conditions:
    if(condition){
    any line of code even  another if condition

    if(){

    }
    }

Important notes:
    1) For string, we can use equals method instead of == sign b/c it's a non-primitive data type.
    2) We can ctrl+alt+l to format our code.
    3) If wee are confused about brackets, we can click on opening/closing part to check the other part.

If else conditions:
If I have to test the same variable for multiple conditions, I should use 'If Else if'.
If I have multiple conditions & these conditions are dependent on each other 'Nested if' conditions
